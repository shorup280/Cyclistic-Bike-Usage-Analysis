# Cyclistic Bike Usage Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the bike usage data of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. The goal is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, which will help the company develop targeted marketing strategies.

---

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to answer the following question:
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

By identifying patterns in bike usage, we can make data-driven recommendations to improve Cyclistic's marketing strategies.

## Files in this Repository
- **`Cyclistic_Bike_Usage_Analysis.Rmd`**: The main R Markdown file containing all the code and analysis steps.
- **`Cyclistic_Bike_Usage_Analysis.pptx`**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings and visualizations.
- **`analysisCodeScript.R`**: Contains all the R code used for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **`average_duration_by_user_type.png`**: A plot showing the average ride duration for annual members and casual riders.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R Programming**: Data analysis and visualization
- **RMarkdown**: For creating the analysis report
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization

## Key Findings
1. **Ride Duration**: Casual riders generally have a longer ride duration compared to annual members.
2. **Usage Patterns**: Annual members tend to use bikes more frequently during weekdays, while casual riders prefer weekends.
3. **Peak Hours**: The most common times for rides differ between the two user types.

## Instructions to Run the Project
1. Open the `Cyclistic_Bike_Usage_Analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Ensure that all required packages are installed (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`).
3. Knit the RMarkdown file to generate an HTML or PDF report.

## Future Improvements
- Explore additional datasets for deeper insights.
- Analyze seasonal variations in bike usage.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future usage trends.
